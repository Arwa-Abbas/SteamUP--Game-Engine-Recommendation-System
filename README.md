# SteamUP! – Game Engine Recommendation System #

SteamUP! is an advanced game recommendation platform that leverages both **knowledge-based (constraint-driven)** and **content-based filtering** techniques to provide personalized game suggestions. Built with **FastAPI** and **MongoDB**, the system combines sophisticated similarity metrics, user preferences, and game metadata to deliver accurate and explainable recommendations for gamers.

**Dataset Used:** [Steam Games Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nikatomashvili/steam-games-dataset)


## 📋 Features

### 🧠 Knowledge-Based Recommendations
- Constraint-based filtering (hard & soft constraints)
- Price range filtering (min/max)
- System requirements matching (RAM, storage, OS)
- Language preferences
- Developer/publisher preferences
- Sentiment score and recent reviews filtering (highest sentiment and review score gets priority)
- Tag-based matching
- Score-based ranking 

### 🎯 Content-Based Recommendations
Four similarity metrics:
- **Cosine Similarity** – Angle between feature vectors
- **Pearson Correlation** – Linear correlation coefficient
- **Euclidean Distance** – Inverse distance with Gaussian kernel
- **Jaccard Similarity** – Set overlap between binary features


### 🤝 Hybrid Recommendations
- Intelligent combination of constraint + content-based systems
- Dynamic weighting based on match quality
- penalty system if recommendation only appear in one list - 10% for constraint, 20% for content
- average weight calculation based on similarity if rrecommended game appear in both lists

## Similarity Methods

### Cosine Similarity
Measures angle between vectors (0 → 1).
### Pearson Correlation
Measures linear correlation (-1 → 1).
### Euclidean Similarity
Gaussian-based inverse distance.
### Jaccard Similarity
Set overlap for binary features.

### Memory Efficiency

- Sparse TF-IDF (max 800 features)
- Top-K similarity storage
- Chunked processing
- Float16 / UInt16 compression
- Fallback mechanisms for missing data
